# Usage:
This program can be used as a framwork for ciphering and deciphering messages
as of this date 30/07/21 it only comes with a single algorithm written by Shayikh.
but the user is permitted as per the licence to modify and create his/her own algorithm and use that
with this program.
# NOTE:
Each cipherable/decipherable line must end with "!k"
where ! indicates that the next letter will be interpreted as signature of the algorithm
now k is the only algorithm that may be used.
# Next upcoming features:
1. Bulk File cipher
2. File handling
3. Mathematical formula for faster code execution
4. A new cipher algorithm that may be named as z
# Known Issues:
1. Can not convert more than a single line but the line may be extended upto users choice depending on RAM
2. This script also converts the signature letter into the cipher so be aware of that fact i.e S!k -> X!q
